# SatanAlphabet's Dotfiles

*This setup is currently a work in progress and is subject to constant changes.*

A comfy setup built on [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri "A scrollable-tiling wayland compositor"), featuring coherent & dynamic theming using `matugen`, and a keyboard driven workflow that does not sacrifice on the mouse.

---

## Installation
- This setup is managed by `chezmoi`. Install [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) and proceed to install the setup using the following commands

		chezmoi init SatanAlphabet
  		chezmoi apply
  
  This will additionally run a script to install necessary packages on your first time running `chezmoi apply`.  
  **Note that the install script only supports Arch-based distros and is currently untested on a minimal setup.**
  
- `niri-git` may be required for config [`include`](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Include.html) to work.
